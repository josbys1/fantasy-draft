# Responsive Name Drafting System


This web app allows live drafting of names while in a group, just like a custom fantasy sports draft. This was originally designed to help teachers distribute who would write recommendation letters for their high school students. However, this can be used in any context where you are picking a roster, such as for sports teams. This app is completely repsonsive, so it displays nicely on mobile devices. This can be added to any website as long as the SQL database is properly setup and the correct information is entered into the `dbInfo.php` file.
